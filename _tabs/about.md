Hi! I'm glad to see you've found your way here.

My name is Will Thurston, and at heart, I’m a data nerd. I created this website as a place to share all things data—whether that’s projects I’m working on, concepts I’m learning (or relearning), or just interesting tidbits I’ve come across and want to explore further.

My father is a professor, and I think his love of teaching rubbed off on me (much to the annoyance of my rebellious teenage self). Because of that, I wanted to create a space where I could teach and share the things I’m working through—whether it’s revisiting concepts I first learned years ago or diving into cutting-edge technologies.

I’ve been told by people much wiser than me: “If you can teach it to someone, then you truly know it.” With that in mind, most of what I write here is framed from the perspective of teaching the reader, helping to solidify my own understanding while hopefully making these topics clearer for others.  

At the same time, I’m also using this website as a way to learn web development. As I go, I’m pushing myself to try more creative things, both in the content I write and in how I build the site itself.

For now, I will leave it there. If you'd like to chat feel free to reach out!
