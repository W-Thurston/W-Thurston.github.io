Hey.\
Hey you.\
Come closer.\
I have a secret to share: When it comes to machine learning, there is one function to rule them all.\
\
\begin{eqnarray}
  Y = f\left( X \right) + \epsilon \tag{1}\\
\end{eqnarray}
\
There you go, now you know how every machine learning algorithm out there works!\
See you next time!\
\
...\
\
Oh, you're still here?  I guess giving you that equation and saying "you now understand how machine learning algorithms work" is like handing you a hammer 
and saying "you can now build a house". Let's see if I can break it down a bit more and give you a more concrete example to see if that helps.\
\
\begin{align\*}
  Y = f(X) + \epsilon \\\\<br>
\end{align\*}
Where:  
- $$Y$$: The predictions or output of the function  
- $$X$$: The input values to your function  
- $$f(X)$$: Any function you can imagine that relates X to Y
- $$\epsilon$$ (epsilon): A catch-all value for error  

The phrase “any function you can imagine” might sound vague, so let's clarify. What I mean is that any equation you've ever seen—whether it's a simple, recognizable one like the 
equation for a line, $$y = mx + b$$ or or something as complex as the equations that define a [Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Cell](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)
—they're all just different functions that transform input into output.  So whenever you see $$f(X)$$ (pronounced "F of X"), just know that you are passing some input data ($$X$$) into
 a function, equation, or series of equations, and you now expect some output data ($$Y$$).

### The Difference maker: $$\epsilon$$

At this point, you could go out and start implementing algorithms to make predictions on anything and everything.  But before you do, there's one small detail that can make or 
break your models (and possibly your will to continue in this field): $$\epsilon$$.  This little variable, tacked onto the end of our equation $$(1)$$, is more important than it might seem.  
It acts as a  catch-all that fills in the gap between the output of your function $$f(X)$$ and the *true* relationship between your inputs ($$X$$) and their actual outputs.  
In other words, $$\epsilon$$ reminds us that our model will never perfectly capture reality—there's always some level of uncertainty, missing information, or randomness at play.

So, you might be saying: "That's all good and dandy, but how do I go from this equation to something I can actually use in the real world?" That is a the perfect segue into the next section,
unfortunately for you and for this article's writing flow, there is one more section that I want to mention to really drill home the importance of $$f(X)$$.

### Why the "F" does it matter?

In reality, there is a second equation that we will be working with:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \hat{Y} \approx \hat{f}(X) \tag{2}\\\\<br>
\end{eqnarray}

This equation introduces the 'hat' symbol ( $$\hat{Y}$$, pronounced 'Y hat' ), which tells us that what we are looking at is an estimation and not necesasrily the "true" function. In our case, 
the 'hat' symbol tells us that $$\hat{Y}$$ is not the actual output, but rather our model's best estimate based on the available data. Similarly, $$\hat{f}(X)$$ represents our approximation 
of the "true" relationship between $$X$$ and $$Y$$. 

Here we are again, I've been using this "true" wording without fully clarifying what this means.  When we have any dataset, our first assumption 
is that this data is **not** all of the data that we could possibly gather around this subject.  Another way to phrase this is: the data we have is just a **sample**. 
For example, if we wanted to understand the height of the average human, we could go door to door around the world and collect every single person's height. But this would take forever. 
Instead, we collect information from far fewer people around the world and treat that as a decent representation of the total human population.  The more people we gather information from, 
the closer our sample's average height will be to the true average height of all humans. Since most of our datasets are just samples rather than the entire population, when we create models, 
we are only producting estimations of the "true" model.  When you see equation $$(2)$$, think: 
> This is only an estimation of the 'true' relationship between $$X$$ and $$Y$$ because we don't have all the data needed to produce equation $$(1)$$.

Since we almost never have access to the full population data, our focus when building models is to build them such that we generalize well from samples. Our goal is to find an $$\hat{f}(X)$$ 
that approximates $$f(X)$$ while minimizing error, ensuring that our model performs well not just on our sample, but on unseen data too.
